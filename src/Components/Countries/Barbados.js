                A diplomatic passport is a type of passport that is issued to
                diplomats and other officials who are traveling abroad on
                official business. Diplomatic passports are issued by the
                government of the diplomat's home country and are typically
                valid for a period of five years.
                <br /> <br /> Diplomatic passports differ from regular passports
                in that they grant certain privileges and immunities to the
                holder while they are abroad. These privileges and immunities
                are granted to facilitate the work of diplomats and other
                officials and to protect them from interference while they are
                conducting official business.
                <br /> <br />
                <span className="font-bold">
                  Diplomatic passports are not available to the general public
                  and are typically only issued to individuals who are serving
                  in a diplomatic capacity or to other officials who are
                  traveling abroad on official business. If you are not a
                  diplomat or an official traveling abroad on official business,
                  you will typically not be eligible to apply for a diplomatic
                  passport.
