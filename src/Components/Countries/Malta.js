                  initiating their travel plans. Foreign citizens should also
                  seek guidance from the Maltese embassy or consulate in their

                <br /> <br /> In general, foreign citizens who are required to
                obtain a visa to enter Malta will need to provide the following

                provide the following documents:
                <br />
                <br />
                ● A valid passport with at least six months of validity

                ● Proof of sufficient funds to cover your stay in Malta.
                <br />
                <br />
                ● A letter of invitation if applicable.

                ● Confirmation of return or onward travel, if required.
                <br />
                <br />
                For specific type of visa you are applying, the requirement may
                vary. It's also important to note that these requirements may
                vary based on your nationality, the purpose of your trip and the
                duration of your stay.
                <br />
                <br />
                Once you have collected all the required documents, you can
                submit your visa application at the Maltese consulate or embassy
                in your home country. It's always recommended to check the
                website of Malta's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the most
                up-to-date information on visa requirements and the process for
                submitting your application.
                <br />

                <span className="font-bold">
                  It's also important to be aware that, Malta is a member of the
                  European Union, but it is not a member of the Schengen Area.
                  Thus, if you are a holder of Schengen visa it does not grant
                  you the right to enter Malta, and you will still need to apply
                  for a Malta visa if you wish to visit Malta.

                A diplomatic passport is a special type of passport that is
                issued to individuals who represent their country in a
                diplomatic capacity, such as ambassadors, diplomats, and certain
                government officials.
                <br />
                <br />
                In the case of Malta, a diplomatic passport is issued to
                individuals who are appointed as representatives of Malta to
                foreign states, international organizations, or other foreign
                entities.
                <br />
                <br />
                Holders of a Maltese diplomatic passport are entitled to certain
                privileges and immunities under international law, such as
                immunity from arrest and prosecution, and special privileges
                with regard to taxes, customs, and immigration.
                <br />
                <br />
                It's worth noting that Maltese diplomatic passport holders are
                able to travel visa free to around 130 countries and
                territories, including many EU countries and the United States.
                <br />
                <br />
                In order to obtain a diplomatic passport in Malta, one typically
                needs to be appointed by the government of Malta to a diplomatic
                position and will usually need to provide documentation to
                confirm their status and purpose of travel.
