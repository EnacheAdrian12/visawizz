                The length of time you can stay in Norway depends on the type of
                visa you have obtained and the purpose of your visit.
                <br />
                <br />
                If you are a citizen of a country that is part of the European
                Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA) which includes
                Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland or a citizen of
                a country that is on the list of countries that can enter Norway
                without a visa, you will be able to stay in Norway for up to 90
                days within a 180-day period without a visa, for tourism,
                visiting friends and family, or business purposes.
                <br />
                <br />
                If you are a citizen of a country that requires a visa to enter
                Norway, you may be able to stay for a longer period, depending
                on the type of visa you have obtained.
                <br />
                <br />
                For example, a short-stay (Schengen) visa will typically allow
                you to stay in Norway for up to 90 days within a 180-day period.
                A long-stay visa will typically allow you to stay for up to a
                year, and a residence permit will allow you to stay for a longer
                period, usually up to five years, and can be renewed.

                  It's important to note that the duration of your stay in
                  Norway is determined by the date of entry stamped on your

                diplomatic capacity, such as ambassadors, diplomats, and certain
                government officials. In the case of Norway, a diplomatic
                passport is issued to individuals who are appointed as
                representatives of the Norwegian government to foreign states,
                international organizations, or other foreign entities.
                <br />

                Liechtenstein and Switzerland, but is not a member of the
                European Union, the holder of a Norwegian Diplomatic passport
                can travel visa-free within the Schengen Area and EEA countries.
                <br />
                <br />
                In order to obtain a diplomatic passport in Norway, one
                typically needs to be appointed by the government of Norway to a
                diplomatic position and will usually need to provide
