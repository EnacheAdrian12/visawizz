                In Paraguay, diplomatic passports are issued by the Ministry of
                Foreign Affairs to individuals who are representatives of the
                Paraguayan government, such as diplomats, consular officers, and
                certain government officials. Holders of Paraguayan diplomatic
                passports are accorded certain privileges and immunities under
                international law, including exemption from visa requirements
                when traveling to other countries for official business.
                However, it's important to note that the privileges and
                immunities associated with a Paraguayan diplomatic passport may
                vary depending on the country. It's also worth mentioning that
                Paraguay is a member of MERCOSUR, the Southern Common Market, a
                regional trade bloc in South America, which facilitates the free
                movement of citizens among its member countries, with some
                exceptions.
